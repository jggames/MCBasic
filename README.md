# MCBasic
 Micro Color Basic Games by Jim Gerrie for Greg Dionne's MCBasic

These programs are original programs by me for testing the TRS-80 BASIC compiler "MCBASIC" being developed by Greg Dionne: https://github.com/gregdionne/mcbasic?fbclid=IwAR128xMwCiP_CnpsfA_7xRaYyY_5USt_44tGgdkYA33TmpdomFpNzVV-1_M

These programs can also be used with the Quicktype feature of the VMC10 emulator by James the Animal Tamer.  (Be sure to type NEW before Quicktyping).

Most require the use of the 16K RAM expander.  With the emulator, 
Configure >> Memory... and select these two options:
* RAM Normal (as sold in stores) 
* +16K RAM Expansion (as sold in stores)

If you have a real MC10, you'll need a real MC10 16K RAM expander.


To use one of these programs with a real MC-10, you'd have to Quicktype it into the emulator, then CSAVE it to make a .c10 file.  Then, use the C10TOWAV utility (in the Tools directory) to make a WAV file.  Finally, this WAV file can be played back to an audio-connected MC-10, or it could be played back and recorded by an audio-connected cassette recorder.
